You can find more information on the available configuration options in the Configuration section.\\n\\n\\n\\nRunning via Docker Compose\\u200b\\nThe following explains how to run the LangSmith using Docker Compose. This is the most flexible way to run LangSmith without Kubernetes. The default configuration for Docker Compose is intended for local testing only and not for instances where any services are exposed to the public internet. In production, we highly recommend using a secured Kubernetes environment.\\n1. Fetch the LangSmith docker-compose.yml file\\u200b\\nYou can find the docker-compose.yml file and related files in the LangSmith SDK repository here: LangSmith Docker Compose File\\nCopy the docker-compose.yml file and all files in that directory from the LangSmith SDK to your project directory.\\n\\nEnsure that you copy the users.xml file as well.\\n\\n2. Configure environment variables\\u200b\\n\\nCopy the .env.example file from the LangSmith SDK to your project directory and rename it to .env.\\nConfigure the appropriate values in the .env file. You can find the available configuration options in the Configuration section.\\n\\nYou can also set these environment variables in the docker-compose.yml file directly or export them in your terminal. We recommend setting them in the .env file.\\n2. Start server\\u200b\\nStart the LangSmith application by executing the following command in your terminal:\\ndocker-compose up\\nYou can also run the server in the background by running:\\ndocker-compose up -d\\nValidate your deployment:\\u200b\\n\\n\\nCurl the exposed port of the cli-langchain-frontend-1 container:\\ncurl localhost:1980/info{\"version\":\"0.5.7\",\"license_expiration_time\":\"2033-05-20T20:08:06\",\"batch_ingest_config\":{\"scale_up_qsize_trigger\":1000,\"scale_up_nthreads_limit\":16,\"scale_down_nempty_trigger\":4,\"size_limit\":100,\"size_limit_bytes\":20971520}}\\n\\n\\nVisit the exposed port of the cli-langchain-frontend-1 container on your browser\\nThe Langsmith UI should be visible/operational at http://localhost:1980\\n\\n\\n\\nChecking the logs\\u200b\\nIf, at any point, you want to check if the server is running and see the logs, run\\ndocker-compose logs\\nStopping the server\\u200b\\ndocker-compose down\\nUsing LangSmith\\u200b\\nNow that LangSmith is running, you can start using it to trace your code. You can find more information on how to use self-hosted LangSmith in the self-hosted usage guide.\\nYour LangSmith instance is now running but may not be fully setup yet.\\nIf you used one of the basic configs, you may have deployed a no-auth configuration.\\nIn this state, there is no authentication or concept of user accounts nor API keys and traces can be submitted directly without an API key so long as the hostname is passed to the LangChain tracer/LangSmith SDK.\\nAs a next step, it is strongly recommended you work with your infrastructure administrators to:\\n\\nSetup DNS for your LangSmith instance to enable easier access\\nConfigure SSL to ensure in-transit encryption of traces submitted to LangSmith\\nConfigure LangSmith for oauth authentication or basic authentication to secure your LangSmith instance\\nSecure access to your Docker environment to limit access to only the LangSmith frontend and API\\nConnect LangSmith to secured Postgres and Redis instances\\nWas this page helpful?You can leave detailed feedback on GitHub.PreviousInstalling on KubernetesNextConfigurationPrerequisitesRunning via Docker Compose1.
